# Vision Intelligence Ethical Statement

Welcome to Vision Intelligence, where we're pioneering the future of AI-assisted manual production. As we embark on this transformative journey, we remain deeply committed to shaping a world where technology amplifies human potential, rather than detracting from it. Our ethical stance centres on several foundational pillars, which guide our every action, product, and service:

## **Our Ethical Pillars:**

### **1. Trust & Transparency**
We believe in fostering a relationship of trust with all stakeholders. This starts with absolute transparency in data collection, ensuring every individual understands and consents to how their data is being utilized. Our systems are designed to complement existing infrastructures, and we consistently work to improve their transparency, usability, and security.

### **2. Justice, Fairness & Autonomy**
Our goal is not to override human judgment or diminish the value of skilled manual labour. Instead, we aim to enhance worker autonomy, assisting with training and incorporating AI assistance seamlessly into their workflows. This empowerment demystifies AI and equips workers with modern-day skills and tools.

### **3. Beneficence with VIOLET AI Systems**
VIOLET AI systems are engineered to bring about tangible benefits. By identifying deviations and documenting processes and standards, our technology contributes towards the goal of optimal production quality and efficiency.

### **4. Data Integrity & Privacy**
Respecting the confidentiality of collected data is paramount. We pledge to use this data solely for improving production quality, steering clear from behaviour monitoring, or any other non-disclosed purpose.

### **5. Human Control & Oversight**
We provide workers with AI assistance, not control and oversight. We firmly believe in the primacy of human oversight so our systems don't replace human roles. Instead, we provide data and insights, giving workers the tools to correct and improve processes, while ensuring humans stay in control.

### **6. Workforce Empowerment**
Our commitment is to uplift the meaningful work of the manufacturing workforce. Vision Intelligence's tools and platform enable workers to proactively refine their skills, maintaining their relevance in an evolving industry.

### **7. Environmental Responsibility**
Efficiency is more than just good business; it's an ethical imperative in a world with finite resources. By helping industries reduce wastage and scrap components, our solutions contribute to a more sustainable manufacturing landscape.

### **8. Community Solidarity**
As we innovate, we're conscious of the broader impact on jobs and workplace culture. Our goal is to enhance, not replace. This means considering job redesign, retraining, and other factors to ensure everyone benefits from the AI revolution.

### **9. Integration Excellence**
We recognize the challenges posed by existing machinery and processes. Our promise is to meticulously integrate our systems, considering the nuances and unique requirements of each manufacturing environment.

## **Vision for the Future**
In every endeavor, Vision Intelligence seeks to harmoniously blend human and AI capabilities. We envision a future where AI assistants magnify human skills, fostering an ecosystem imbued with cohesiveness, efficiency, and ethical integrity. Together, let's shape a future that reflects our shared values and aspirations for technology and humanity.
